# ⚗️ Vibe Audit

**Security scanner for AI-generated codebases.**

Vibe coding is fast. Shipping insecure code is faster. Vibe Audit catches the security time bombs that AI tools leave behind — exposed API keys, open database rules, missing auth, XSS vectors, and more — before they blow up in production.

```
npx vibe-audit
```

No config required. Zero production dependencies. 39 rules. Runs in under a second.

## Why This Exists

AI coding tools generate working code. But "working" and "secure" aren't the same thing. Every day, developers ship vibe-coded apps with:

- API keys hardcoded in source files
- Firestore rules set to `allow read, write: if true`
- API routes with zero authentication
- User input piped straight into `innerHTML` or SQL queries
- Paid API calls with no rate limiting (hello, surprise $10K bill)
- Passwords stored in plaintext
- Webhook handlers that accept fake events without verification

Vibe Audit finds these issues in seconds and tells you exactly how to fix them — with plain-English explanations AND copy-paste prompts that work in any AI coding tool (Claude Code, Cursor, Lovable, Replit, Firebase Studio, and more).

## Quick Start

```bash
# Audit current directory
npx vibe-audit

# Audit a specific project
npx vibe-audit ./my-app

# Get fix prompts for your AI coding tool
npx vibe-audit --fix

# Save fix guide only (no terminal output)
npx vibe-audit --fix-file

# JSON output for CI
npx vibe-audit --format json --strict

# Markdown report with copy-paste fix prompts
npx vibe-audit --format markdown > audit-report.md
```

## Copy-Paste Fix Prompts

Every finding includes a **copy-paste prompt** you can drop directly into your AI coding tool. Prompts include platform-specific notes for each tool's capabilities and limitations.

**Get them with markdown or JSON output:**

```bash
# Markdown report with fix prompts
npx vibe-audit --format markdown > audit-report.md

# JSON with prompts (for automation)
npx vibe-audit --format json
```

## Programmatic API

```js
import { audit } from 'vibe-audit';

const { findings, exitCode } = await audit('/path/to/project', {
  format: 'json',
  strict: true,
});

console.log(`Found ${findings.length} issues`);
```

---

## Design Principles

**AST-powered analysis.** The highest-impact rules (IDOR, mass assignment, missing auth) use acorn to parse your code into an Abstract Syntax Tree and analyze it per-function. This means we can tell the difference between "this function checks ownership" and "some other function in the file checks ownership" — a distinction regex alone can't make.

**Minimal dependencies.** Two production dependencies: `acorn` (the parser behind ESLint and webpack) and `acorn-loose` (tolerant parsing for AI-generated code that may have syntax quirks). No bloated dependency tree.

**Zero false positives over catching everything.** A rule that cries wolf gets disabled. Every pattern is tuned to minimize noise. Clean code triggers zero findings (verified by regression tests on a fully-secured fixture).

**Every finding includes a fix AND a prompt.** Plain English explanation for understanding PLUS a copy-paste prompt for action. No "go read the OWASP docs."

**It audits itself.** `npm run audit:self` — Vibe Audit passes its own checks in strict mode.
