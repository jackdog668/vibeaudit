# ⚗️ Vibe Audit

**Security scanner for AI-generated codebases.**

Vibe coding is fast. Shipping insecure code is faster. Vibe Audit catches the security time bombs that AI tools leave behind — exposed API keys, open database rules, missing auth, XSS vectors, prompt injection, unverified payment webhooks, and more — before they blow up in production.

```bash
npx @jackdog668/vibeaudit
```

No config required. **106 rules** across 17 attack surfaces, including poisoned agent files and download-to-execution chains. Two production dependencies. Runs in seconds.

> Every finding ships with a CWE ID, a CVSS v3.1 score, an OWASP Top 10 mapping, a plain-English explanation, **and** a copy-paste fix prompt for your AI coding tool.

---

## Why This Exists

AI coding tools generate working code. But "working" and "secure" aren't the same thing. Every day, developers ship vibe-coded apps with:

- API keys hardcoded in source files
- `service_role` keys and Firebase Admin SDK shipped to the browser
- Supabase tables with Row Level Security turned off
- Firestore rules set to `allow read, write: if true`
- API routes and Server Actions with zero authentication
- User input piped straight into `innerHTML`, SQL, NoSQL, or an LLM prompt
- Stripe webhooks accepted without signature verification
- Paid AI calls with no spend limit (hello, surprise $10K bill)

Vibe Audit finds these in seconds and tells you exactly how to fix them — with explanations AND copy-paste prompts that work in any AI coding tool (Claude Code, Cursor, Lovable, Replit, Firebase Studio, and more).

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Audit the current directory
npx @jackdog668/vibeaudit

# Audit a specific local project
npx @jackdog668/vibeaudit ./my-app

# Audit a GitHub repo directly — no clone needed (scanned via the GitHub API)
npx @jackdog668/vibeaudit owner/repo
npx @jackdog668/vibeaudit https://github.com/owner/repo

# Deep scan — also check git history for committed secrets
npx @jackdog668/vibeaudit --deep

# Interactive HTML report (security grade A–F, CVSS charts, OWASP grid)
npx @jackdog668/vibeaudit --format html

# Copy-paste fix prompts for your AI coding tool
npx @jackdog668/vibeaudit --fix

# JSON output for CI
npx @jackdog668/vibeaudit --format json --strict
```

**Install globally** if you run it a lot:

```bash
npm install -g @jackdog668/vibeaudit
vibeaudit            # then just call it directly
```

Requires Node `>=18.19.0`.

## VibeGuard: Protection Outside the Project Folder

### Review and install an npm dependency

The protected npm workflow reviews dependencies against your app's actual manifest
and lockfile, then installs the exact reviewed archives offline with scripts disabled.
It retains the previous installation for rollback. From this checkout:

```bash
node bin/vibeguard.js npm review picocolors@1.1.1 --project /path/to/app
# Read the package results, then use the returned ID in both positions:
node bin/vibeguard.js npm install <review-id> --accept <review-id>
node bin/vibeguard.js npm status <review-id>
node bin/vibeguard.js npm rollback <review-id>
```

The first version supports single projects using the public npm registry. It does
not run installation scripts or protect later application execution. See the
[installation guide](docs/protected-npm-install.md) for approval, recovery, and limits.

The new **offline protection pilot** runs an explicitly reviewed Node skill in a
restricted Linux Docker container. It binds approval to the exact skill and input,
disables networking, and records execution and cleanup evidence. Start with
`node bin/vibeguard.js pilot --help` and the [pilot guide](docs/protection-pilot.md).
This is an opt-in execution pilot; live AI assistants and provider access are outside its scope.

The scanner checks a project when you run it. **VibeGuard** adds user-wide checks that run before supported AI tools or interactive PowerShell execute a command.

### Check local security tools

Run the doctor before your first full audit or agent-skill install. It checks Node.js, Cosign, OSV-Scanner, and optional Gitleaks. It provides official release links and exact Cosign and OSV-Scanner digest evidence without downloading tools or executing installers.

```powershell
vibeaudit doctor
vibeaudit doctor --format json
```

Exit code `0` means every required tool is authenticated and usable. Optional Gitleaks can remain `available-unverified`, producing `usable-with-warnings` without blocking normal work. Exit code `3` means a required tool is missing, rejected, or unsupported. Cosign and OSV-Scanner both receive approved-release digest checks.

### Scan a backup before restoring agent files

Keep the backup offline. This command inventories recognized skills, hooks, agent instructions, configs, plugins, Cursor rules, and helper scripts. It analyzes linked files as one capability chain and blocks incomplete coverage.

```powershell
vibeaudit agent scan "D:\Recovered Backup"
```

Add Gitleaks when it is already installed locally. Vibe Audit does not download it. The adapter scans a sanitized staging copy of recognized agent files, forces the bundled default-rule configuration, ignores target allow comments and ignore files, and removes secret values from its report. A missing or failed Gitleaks executable is a blocking incomplete scan.

```powershell
vibeaudit agent scan "D:\Recovered Backup" --gitleaks
```

Add Semgrep when you need a deeper data-flow pass over agent scripts and hooks. It is opt-in, scans only staged JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python files, and uses bundled rules with metrics disabled. Vibe Audit does not download rules, load target configuration, or execute the staged files. A missing or failed Semgrep executable is a blocking incomplete scan.

```powershell
vibeaudit agent scan "D:\Recovered Backup" --semgrep
```

The bundled rules look for credential or file data flowing into network and process-execution sinks. Semgrep's taint mode provides this flow-aware coverage beyond pattern matching. See the [Semgrep taint-mode guide](https://semgrep.dev/blog/2022/demystifying-taint-mode/) for the underlying analysis model.

After reading every listed control file, save its SHA-256 inventory somewhere outside the backup. Verification detects added, changed, and deleted controls.

```powershell
vibeaudit agent baseline "D:\Recovered Backup" `
  --baseline "C:\Security State\recovered-backup.json" `
  --i-reviewed-these-files

vibeaudit agent verify "D:\Recovered Backup" `
  --baseline "C:\Security State\recovered-backup.json"
```

Inspect a command without executing it:

```powershell
Get-Clipboard | vibeaudit command inspect --stdin
```

Exit code `0` passes. Exit code `3` requires review. Exit code `4` blocks because danger or incomplete coverage was found.

### Install the optional agent skill safely

The installer never uses a force-overwrite flag. It shows the packaged SHA-256 hash, target hashes, exact diffs, and security findings before writing. Installation requires an interactive confirmation containing the full reviewed hash. Existing files receive timestamp-independent backups, every write is rehashed, and the final file is added to VibeGuard's trust baseline.

```powershell
vibeaudit skill plan
vibeaudit skill install
```

Official npm releases include a Sigstore bundle for the packaged skill and a second signed baseline containing its expected SHA-256 digest, size, package name, and version. `skill plan` verifies both bundles with Cosign before showing any install target. It requires the exact versioned Digital Alchemy release-workflow identity, GitHub's OIDC issuer, the artifact digest, and the bundled transparency-log proof. `skill install` repeats the verification immediately before writing. One command authenticates and stages Cosign once, then reuses that private copy for every required artifact check.

Install Cosign 3.1.3 separately from its [official release](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/releases/tag/v3.1.3). Vibe Audit never downloads Cosign. It checks the executable against Sigstore's pinned release digest, stages a private copy, and rejects other PATH executables. Unsigned source checkouts cannot install the official skill.

Use `--only claude`, `--only codex`, or `--only cursor` to narrow the targets. `vibeaudit skill print` prints the packaged instructions without writing anything.

On Windows, review the installer and your current AI control files first. Then preview every planned change:

```powershell
Get-Content -LiteralPath .\scripts\install-vibeguard.ps1
node .\bin\vibeguard.js preflight
.\scripts\install-vibeguard.ps1 -WhatIf
```

`preflight` rereads every recognized agent file and reports critical patterns, warnings, and unreadable paths without trusting anything. Add `--json` for the complete file and hash inventory. The installer stops before writing any file when preflight finds a critical pattern or incomplete coverage.

Activate only after that manual review:

```powershell
.\scripts\install-vibeguard.ps1 -BaselineReviewed
```

The installer merges VibeGuard into your existing Claude and Codex user hooks. It also adds a command check to new PowerShell 5 and PowerShell 7 sessions. It keeps timestamped backups beside every changed configuration file.

VibeGuard blocks or pauses these paths:

- Downloaded content piped directly into PowerShell, Bash, Python, Node, or another interpreter.
- Encoded PowerShell, common Windows malware launchers, and download-then-run command chains.
- AI edits to `SKILL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, hooks, settings, and other recognized agent control files.
- AI reads or edits of credential-bearing local paths such as `.env`, SSH keys, cloud credential stores, and browser session databases.
- Script-based attempts to read secrets or rewrite agent control files.
- New or changed agent files that do not match your manually reviewed hash baseline.
- Agent instructions that combine downloads, execution, stealth, persistence, or credential collection.
- External MCP actions that mutate state, such as uploads, sends, installs, deploys, or credential operations.
- AI publication, deployment, repository push, and recursive destructive commands that need a human decision.

For a legitimate package install or executable download, independently verify the official domain, publisher, signature, and checksum. Then create one short-lived approval from a separate prompt:

```powershell
vibeguard approve-command
```

Paste the exact verified command when asked. The approval works once, only in that PowerShell process, and expires after ten minutes. Download-to-interpreter commands cannot be approved.

If an agent file changes, inspect every line yourself. Then update only that reviewed file:

```powershell
vibeguard status
vibeguard trust-file "C:\path\to\SKILL.md" --i-reviewed-this-file
```

Remove the integration without deleting your timestamped backups:

```powershell
.\scripts\install-vibeguard.ps1 -Uninstall
```

**Important limit:** VibeGuard is a user-level guardrail, not an operating-system security boundary. It does not intercept `cmd.exe`, WSL, GUI installers, browser downloads, unsupported assistants, non-interactive PowerShell scripts, or malware already running with your user or administrator rights. Use Microsoft Defender, SmartScreen, signed downloads, publisher verification, and least-privilege accounts as separate layers.

Claude and Codex hooks can deny supported tool calls, while PowerShell's command validation handler runs before an interactive command executes. Review the official [Claude hooks](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks), [Codex hooks](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/hooks), and [PowerShell PSReadLine](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/PSReadline/set-psreadlineoption?view=powershell-5.1) documentation before activation.

| `docker-root-user` | 🟡 | 6.5 | CWE-250 | Dockerfiles running containers as `root` |
| `exposed-database-port` | 🟡 | 5.3 | CWE-284 | Database ports exposed to the host in compose files |
| `serverless-fs-write` | 🟡 | — | — | Filesystem writes / SQLite in serverless routes — ephemeral disk, data silently lost |

### ♿ Accessibility / WCAG

Level A checks that the automated scanners lawyers run (PowerMapper, axe, WAVE) flag. These carry a **WCAG success criterion**, not a CWE — accessibility is conformance, not a security weakness. An accessibility statement or overlay widget does **not** stop those scanners; real conformance does. Static analysis catches the low-hanging misses — pair with axe-core to verify screen-reader UX.

| Rule | Sev | WCAG | What it catches |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `a11y-img-no-alt` | 🟡 | 1.1.1 (A) | `<img>` / `next/image` with no `alt` |
| `a11y-form-no-label` | 🟡 | 1.3.1 (A) | Inputs with no associated label or `aria-label` |
| `a11y-no-lang` | 🟡 | 3.1.1 (A) | `<html>` with no `lang` attribute |
| `a11y-button-no-name` | 🟡 | 4.1.2 (A) | Buttons with no text and no `aria-label` |
| `a11y-positive-tabindex` | 🟡 | 2.4.3 (A) | `tabindex` > 0 — breaks the keyboard tab order |
| `a11y-click-no-keyboard` | 🟡 | 2.1.1 (A) | `onClick` on a non-interactive element with no keyboard handler |

### ⚡ Scale / Performance

The real culprits behind the "$50k server bill" — named, not vibed. Quality/scale checks, not security findings, so they carry no CWE/OWASP. Missing DB indexes, caching, and connection pooling are **not** statically detectable — that judgment lives in the DA Pre-Flight Audit Prompt, not the scanner.

| Rule | Sev | What it catches |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `perf-n-plus-one` | 🟡 | A DB query inside a loop or `.map`/`.forEach` (the N+1 pattern) |
| `perf-no-await-parallel` | 🟡 | Sequential `await` in a loop that should run in parallel with `Promise.all` |
| `perf-db-client-per-request` | 🟡 | Pooled DB client (`new PrismaClient()`, pg `Pool`) created per-request — exhausts the connection pool |

### 📡 Observability

| Rule | Sev | What it catches |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `no-error-monitoring` | ⚪ | Web app with no error monitor (Sentry, Rollbar, Bugsnag…) — production errors fail silently |

### 📦 Dependencies (SCA)

Beyond the 106 rules above, Vibe Audit runs **software composition analysis** through two independent layers. `npm audit` preserves npm-specific advisory coverage. OSV-Scanner covers supported npm, Python, Go, Rust, CycloneDX, and SPDX dependency inventories, including transitive lockfile entries. The pre-install `--precheck` still catches fresh-package behavior that advisory databases cannot know yet.

OSV runs by default. Vibe Audit stages only recognized inputs, ignores target-supplied OSV configuration, and fails closed when the trusted binary is missing. Use `--skip-osv` for an explicit OSV exception. Use `--skip-sca` only when all dependency scanning must be disabled.

Container manifests are inventoried, but a Dockerfile cannot prove what entered the built image. Generate a CycloneDX or SPDX SBOM for the built image, then rerun Vibe Audit. Vibe Audit never pulls, starts, or executes an image.

Install OSV-Scanner 2.5.1 separately from its [official release](https://github.com/google/osv-scanner/releases/tag/v2.5.1). Vibe Audit authenticates the platform-specific SHA-256 digest, stages a private copy, and runs only those approved bytes. It never downloads a scanner or runs a package-manager install script on your behalf.

## Configuration

Drop a `.vibe-audit.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "ignore": ["legacy/", "vendor/"],
  "exclude": ["predictable-ids"],
  "format": "terminal",
  "strict": false,
  "osv": true,
  "customEscapers": ["myEscapeHtml"],
  "customAuthGuards": ["requireAuthedApiFromReq"],
  "disableForPaths": { "missing-auth": ["public/"] }
}
```

`disableForPaths` patterns are matched as plain **substrings** against the file path, not as regexes. That is deliberate: a scanned repo supplies its own `.vibe-audit.json`, and compiling a regex from untrusted input is a denial-of-service vector. Leading `^` and trailing `$` are stripped for compatibility, so an anchored pattern still works, but no regex is ever compiled.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ignore` | string[] | `[]` | Extra directories to skip |
| `rules` | string[] | `[]` | Only run these rules (empty = all) |
| `exclude` | string[] | `[]` | Skip these rules |
| `format` | string | `"terminal"` | `terminal`, `json`, `markdown`, or `html` |
| `strict` | boolean | `false` | Exit 1 on warnings too |
| `osv` | boolean | `true` | Run the external OSV-Scanner adapter against supported dependency lockfiles and SBOMs |
| `customEscapers` | string[] | `[]` | Extra HTML escaper/sanitizer names that make `innerHTML` / `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` safe |
| `customAuthGuards` | string[] | `[]` | Extra auth-guard function names that satisfy `missing-auth` / server-action checks |
| `disableForPaths` | object | `{}` | Per-rule path patterns to skip, e.g. `{ "rule-id": ["^public/"] }` |

CLI flags override config file values.

For safety, the CLI ignores a scanned target's `.vibe-audit.json` and inline suppression comments by default. This prevents a hostile repository from disabling the checks meant to inspect it. Add `--trust-target-config` only after reviewing that target's configuration and suppression comments.

### Suppressing a finding

When a finding is a false positive, silence it inline with a comment:

```js
// vibe-audit-ignore-next-line missing-auth
export async function GET(req) { /* intentionally public */ }

const admin = createServiceRoleClient(); // vibe-audit-ignore supabase-service-key-client
```

A bare `// vibe-audit-ignore` (no rule id) suppresses every rule on that line; comma-separate ids to silence several. Inline suppressions apply only when the CLI is run with `--trust-target-config`.

> **Note on framework awareness:** Vibe Audit understands Next.js App Router context. A file is treated as **server** by default — importing React does not make it "client." Server-only code (`import 'server-only'`, route handlers, `'use server'`) is exempt from client-exposure rules, and auth guards imported from your own libs are recognized automatically.

## Programmatic API

```js
import { audit } from '@jackdog668/vibeaudit';

const { findings, exitCode } = await audit('/path/to/project', {
  format: 'json',
  strict: true,
  osv: true, // Default. Set false only for an explicit exception.
});

console.log(`Found ${findings.length} issues`);
```

## Design Principles

**AST-powered analysis.** The highest-impact rules (IDOR, mass assignment, missing auth, N+1 queries) use [acorn](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn) to parse your code into an Abstract Syntax Tree and analyze it per-function. This means we can tell the difference between "this function checks ownership" and "some other function in the file does" — a distinction regex alone can't make.

**Minimal dependencies.** Two production dependencies: `acorn` (the parser behind ESLint and webpack) and `acorn-loose` (tolerant parsing for AI-generated code that may have syntax quirks). No bloated dependency tree.

**Industry-standard metadata.** Every **security** rule is mapped to a CWE ID, a CVSS v3.1 base score, and an OWASP Top 10 (2021) category. Accessibility rules carry a WCAG success criterion, and scale/performance rules are quality checks — all surfaced in every output format.

**Zero false positives over catching everything.** A rule that cries wolf gets disabled. Every pattern is tuned to minimize noise. Clean code triggers zero findings (verified by regression tests on a fully-secured fixture).

**Every finding includes a fix AND a prompt.** Plain-English explanation for understanding PLUS a copy-paste prompt for action. No "go read the OWASP docs."

**It audits itself.** `npm run audit:self` runs the trusted repository configuration in strict mode. The regression suite contains more than 480 tests.


## Roadmap

- **DAST (Phase 2)** — dynamic scanning stubs for ZAP + Nuclei are in place for live-endpoint testing.
